Prototype & Inheritance — JavaScript Deep Dive

This repository contains a collection of small, 
  focused code snippets exploring constructor functions, prototype chains, method overriding, 
  `Object.setPrototypeOf`, `Object.create`, and class inheritance in JavaScript.  

  
Topics Covered
- Creating objects with prototypes
- Understanding `__proto__` vs `[[Prototype]]`
- Prototype inheritance with ES6 classes
- Method overriding
- Changing an object's prototype dynamically
- Checking prototype relationships
- Using `Object.setPrototypeOf` to modify chains


Notes
- All examples include detailed comments and clear explanations in the code.  
- These examples are written for educational purposes.  
- Each file is independent — you can run them in any order in node.js.  
- The goal is to understand how prototypes and inheritance work in JavaScript by seeing small, isolated behaviors.
